            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I began working in construction at the age of 14, gaining
              experience across a wide range of trades. Early on, I discovered a
              passion for building and creating, which has stayed with me
              throughout my life. My first job was selling newspaper
              subscriptions, but I always gravitated toward hands-on work and
              problem-solving.
            </p>

            <p>
              As an adult, my interest in technology grew alongside my love for
              video games and storytelling. I began experimenting with amateur
              coding and game design, turning a hobby into a serious pursuit. I
              realized that the skills I honed in construction—planning,
              building, and creating—could translate into building websites,
              apps, and even games.
            </p>

            <p>
              After facing significant challenges in 2024, including job loss
              and homelessness with my family, I found support through the
              Orange County Rescue Mission. This experience gave me the
              opportunity to return to education, earn my GED, and enroll in an
              online coding bootcamp. What started as a hobby has now become my
              profession, and I am passionate about continuing to grow as a
              developer and creator.

            <p>
              Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring creative projects, designing
              video games, reading, and building solutions that challenge me to
              learn and grow. I am driven by curiosity, creativity, and the
              desire to turn ideas into tangible results.
